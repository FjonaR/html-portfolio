<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Fjona Re√ßica, I am 23 years old and hold a bachelors degree in law from the University of Prishtina.
  I would describe myself as a person who is always looking for new opportunities. During my university years I spent
  most of my time focusing on my studies, however I was also part of different courses, volunteer work, internships, 
  and a semester abroad. These experiences have helped shape my skills and personality in many ways.</p>

<p>One experience I would put more emphasis on is my experience as an exchange student at the University of Wisconsin, 
  Eau Claire in the United States which has developed my multicultural awareness and sensitivity to behaviors and norms 
  exhibited by people from outside of my own culture. This is something that is very important for me, being able to open 
  new horizons by communicating with people, by meeting a lot of different people, not just staying inside my own circle. 
  Also, during my time there I have been able to challenge myself with different learning techniques which then turned out 
  to be very beneficial for me.</p>

<p>I am a dedicated worker and I take every responsibility with a lot of passion and I try to dedicate myself fully. I believe 
  that these are some of the characteristics that have helped me in my previous experiences and will also help me in the next one.
  An important focus of mine at the moment is to learn and grow professionally, so I am more than willing to take on new 
  responsibilities and challenges.</p>
